{"name":"Fcb","tagline":"Files Cloud Backuper (FCB) allows you to easily upload files to a cloud storage of your preference. ","body":"### How do I upload a directory with FCB?\r\n    fcb-upload settings.xml my_directory_to_upload\r\nThat's it!\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n    pip install Files_Cloud_Backuper\r\n\r\n**Important**: for Mega.co.nz you also need to install [megatools](https://github.com/megous/megatools)\r\n\r\nTo create the database which will hold the registry of files stored, execute:\r\n    fcb-createdb\r\n\r\nThis will create a ```data.db``` which you must have in the local directory every time you execute ```fcb-upload```\r\n\r\n### Configuring\r\nFCB requires information about the cloud service(s) which will be used. [1]\r\n\r\nCurrent version supports any POP3 mail account and Mega.co.nz. [1]\r\n\r\n[1] For more information checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/MatiasSM/fcb/wiki)\r\n\r\n#### Mega.co.nz destination\r\nThe minimal [2] required setting for backuping to a Mega.co.nz account is:\r\n```xml\r\n<mega_sender>\r\n</mega_sender>\r\n```\r\nThis will use your [megatools](https://github.com/megous/megatools) settings to connect to the service. \r\n\r\n[2] Minimal but not necessarily recommended. Checkout the [wiki](https://github.com/MatiasSM/fcb/wiki).\r\n\r\n#### POP3 mail destination\r\nThe minimal required setting for backuping to a POP3 mail is:\r\n```xml\r\n<configuration>\r\n    <mail_sender>\r\n        <account>\r\n            <limits>\r\n                <max_container_content_size>10M</max_container_content_size>\r\n            </limits>\r\n            <src>\r\n                <mail>my_mail@some_mail_srv.com</mail>\r\n                <user>my_mail_usr</user>\r\n                <password>my_mail_pass</password>\r\n                <server>smtp.mail.some_mail_srv.com</server>\r\n                <use_ssl>1</use_ssl>\r\n            </src>\r\n            <dst_mail>my_cloud_storage@some_mail_srv.com</dst_mail>\r\n        </account>\r\n    </mail_sender>\r\n</configuration>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the settings in ```src``` are the **sending** information (same settings that would need to be configured for a mail sender client). \r\n\r\nThe ```dst_mail```is the mail address which will store the backups (in form of attachments).\r\n\r\n```max_container_content_size``` is not strictly required, but in general mail servers have limits in mail attachments sizes, and this is the way of defining the limit for FCB (**Important** check the [wiki](https://github.com/MatiasSM/fcb/wiki) for further comments)\r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\n**TODO**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
